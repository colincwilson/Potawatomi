Potawatomi is a highly endangered language.

The Potawatomi has developed a writing system for their language within the last couple of decades, with several revisions of the writing system. 
Thus, they have education materials in the first version of the writing system that are not being used because they have not been updated to the new version.
The new version uses more accents on vowels compared to the older version.

This project aims at automating the process of updating the older materials to the new version through different combinations of finite state acceptors and transducers.
Because of the similarity of Potawatomi accents to French accents and the lack of available Potawatomi resources, all language models were built and trained with French data.

All code is in Python.
